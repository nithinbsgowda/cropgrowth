            <h1>RICE</h1>
            <p class="para">The number of days required to grow rice can vary depending on the variety and growing conditions, but on average, it takes around 110 to 150 days from planting to harvest. The growth of rice starts from germination, which occurs after 2-10 days, and the seedling stage lasts for about 20-30 days. Then, the vegetative stage begins, lasting for about 60-80 days, followed by the reproductive stage, which lasts for about 20-30 days. Finally, the maturation stage lasts for about 10-20 days before the rice is ready to be harvested. The specific time frame may vary based on the climate, soil type, water management, and other factors.

After planting, the seeds usually take 2-10 days to germinate, followed by the vegetative stage, which lasts for about 50-70 days. The reproductive stage, when the plants produce tassels and ears, lasts for about 20-30 days, and finally, the maturation stage, when the kernels mature, lasts for about 10-20 days before the maize is ready to be harvested. The specific time frame may vary based on factors such as temperature, moisture, and soil conditions.</p>
